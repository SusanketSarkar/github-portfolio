## 5. Repository Settings

After pushing your code, you'll need to configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Choose **gh-pages** branch and **/ (root)** folder
5. Click **Save**

## 6. Push Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 7. Access Your Site

After the GitHub Action completes successfully, your site will be available at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/portfolio`

## Important Notes:

1. **Repository Name**: Make sure the `basePath` and `assetPrefix` in `next.config.ts` match your repository name
2. **Branch**: The workflow is set to deploy from the `main` branch - adjust if you use a different default branch
3. **Build Time**: The first deployment might take a few minutes
4. **Custom Domain**: If you want to use a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file in the `public` directory

## Troubleshooting:

- If images don't load properly, ensure all image paths are relative and the `images.unoptimized: true` setting is in your config
- Check the Actions tab in your repository to see if the deployment succeeded
- Make sure your repository is public, or you have GitHub Pro/Team for private repository Pages

The deployment will automatically trigger whenever you push to the main branch, keeping your site updated with your latest changes!
